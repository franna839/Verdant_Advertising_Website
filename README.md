# **Verdant \- IoT for Agriculture Website**

This repository contains the official advertising and informational website for **Verdant**, a low-cost IoT environment monitoring system designed to empower small-scale and emerging farmers in South Africa. The website serves as the primary marketing tool to showcase the problem Verdant solves, detail our unique solution, and introduce the team behind the project.

## **About The Project**

### **The Problem**

By 2050, South Africa's population is projected to reach 79.2 million, requiring a 50% increase in food production. Currently, over 20% of the population faces food insecurity. Small-scale farmers are crucial to solving this, but they face significant challenges:

* **Data Deficit:** A lack of access to real-time, actionable data leads to inconsistent yields.  
* **Market Barriers:** Inconsistent crop quality makes it difficult to secure contracts and compete with larger commercial farms.  
* **Technology Gap:** Existing agri-tech solutions are often too expensive and complex for small to medium-sized operations.

### **Our Solution**

Verdant bridges this gap by providing an affordable and user-friendly IoT monitoring system.

**The Verdant Node** is a low-cost, solar-ready sensor hub that provides real-time monitoring of crucial environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, CO2) inside a greenhouse, high tunnel, or low tunnel.

* **Real-Time Data & Alerts:** Get instant notifications on your device when conditions fall outside optimal ranges.  
* **Offline Capability:** The node stores data locally during power or network outages and syncs automatically once reconnected, ensuring no data is lost.  
* **Actionable Insights:** Our platform visualizes data, helping farmers make informed decisions to optimize crop growth and maximize yields.

## **Built With**

This website is built with standard web technologies and a few powerful libraries for interactivity and animations.

* HTML5  
* CSS3  
* JavaScript  
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)  
* [AOS (Animate On Scroll)](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)  
* [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/)

## **Getting Started**

To view and work on this project locally, follow these simple steps.

### **Prerequisites**

* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).  
* A code editor, **Visual Studio Code** is highly recommended.  
* The **Live Server** extension for VS Code.

### **Installation & Viewing**

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.  
2. **Open the project folder** in Visual Studio Code.  
3. **Navigate to the /template directory** in the VS Code explorer.  
4. **Right-click on the index.html file** inside the /template directory.  
5. Select **"Open with Live Server"** from the context menu.

This will launch a local development server and open the website correctly in your browser, ensuring all file paths for images, CSS, and JavaScript work as intended.
